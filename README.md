# TopTravel

Welcome to TopTravel- an app designed to help you and your family/friends keep track of the top travel destinations that you'd like to visit.  Create as many lists as you'd like whether you want to organize by season, occasion, continent, etc. You can also view all lists created by family or friends, however you are only able to edit the lists that you create. 

Unfortunately times are tough these days and travel may be restricted for many of us, but hopefully sooner than later we are all able to get out and explore all of the amazing countries and cultures around the world once again!


## Install Instructions

To use this app- just clone, run bundle install, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.
